# Drowsy Driver Detection System

## Overview
As a project manager at AI Student Collective, I'm leading a 5-person team to create this project that aims to enhance road safety by detecting signs of drowsiness or intoxication in drivers using facial landmarks and machine learning. The system leverages real-time video feed analysis alongside a machine learning model trained on a Kaggle dataset to identify fatigue or impaired behavior, alerting drivers to prevent accidents.
Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasadvpatil/mrl-dataset

## Features
- **Real-Time Eye Blink Detection**: Monitors eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect signs of drowsiness.
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Identifies facial regions to track eye and mouth movements using a pre-trained model.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Trains and evaluates a model using a Kaggle dataset for more accurate drowsiness and intoxication detection.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Plays a warning sound if drowsiness or intoxication is detected.
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for quick response times using `imutils`, `scipy`, and `OpenCV`.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and facial detection.
- **dlib**: For detecting facial landmarks.
- **Pygame**: For audio alerts.
- **scipy**: To compute Euclidean distances for EAR.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation during model training.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Kaggle Dataset
This project utilizes a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) containing labeled images of drowsy and alert drivers. The dataset was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to develop a robust machine learning model capable of detecting drowsy behavior.

## How It Works
1. **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**: Calculates EAR from facial landmarks. If EAR falls below a threshold, the driver is likely drowsy.
2. **Facial Landmark Analysis**: Tracks mouth movements to detect potential yawning (a sign of drowsiness).
3. **Machine Learning Model**: Analyzes features extracted from facial landmarks and predicts driver status (alert or drowsy).
4. **Real-Time Alerts**: When thresholds are breached or the model predicts drowsiness, the system triggers an alert.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `OpenCV`
- `dlib`
- `pygame`
- `imutils`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib pygame imutils scipy pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Usage
1. Download the [shape predictor model](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and place it in the project directory.
2. Ensure the Kaggle dataset is downloaded and placed in the `data/` directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python drunk_drowsy_detection.py
   ```
4. The system will start the camera, monitor driver behavior in real-time, and utilize the trained model for predictions.

### Configuration
- Modify `thresh` (default: `0.25`) in the script to adjust the sensitivity of EAR.
- Adjust `frame_check` (default: `20`) to set the number of consecutive frames required to trigger the alert.

## Future Improvements
- Integrating additional features like head pose estimation for better accuracy.
- Deploying the system on mobile devices or in-vehicle hardware.
- Incorporating deep learning for advanced behavioral analysis.
